    <h2>Asakusa</h2>
    <div class="under-title-section">
        Tokyo's eastern neighbourhoods, on the banks of the Sumida-gawa, have an old-Tokyo (shitamachi) feel, with
        venerable temples and shrines, lovely gardens, traditional restaurants and artisan shops.

        <h3>
            Senso-ji
        </h3>
        <div class="div-h3">
            Tokyo’s most visited temple enshrines a golden image of Kannon (the Buddhist goddess of mercy, which,
            according to legend, was miraculously pulled out of the nearby Sumida-gawa by two fishermen in AD 628.
            The
            image has remained on the spot ever since but is never on public display. The present structure dates
            from
            1958.
            <br><br>
            Senso-ji is always busy, particularly on weekends; consider visiting in the evening to see it with fewer
            people and the buildings beautifully illuminated.
            <br><br>
            The main entrance to the temple complex is via the fantastic, red Kaminari-mon and busy shopping street
            Nakamise-dori. Before passing through the gate, look to either side to see statues of Fujin (the god of
            wind) and Raijin (the god of thunder), and under the giant red lantern to see a beautiful carved dragon.
            <br><br>
            Stalls along Nakamise-dori sell everything from tourist trinkets to genuine Edo-style crafts. At the end
            of
            Nakamise-dori is the temple itself, and to your left you’ll spot the 55m-high Five-Storey Pagoda. The
            1973
            reconstruction of a pagoda built by Tokugawa Iemitsu was renovated in 2017.
            <br><br>
            It’s a mystery as to whether or not the ancient image of Kannon actually exists, as it’s not on public
            display. This doesn’t stop a steady stream of worshippers from visiting. In front of the temple is a
            large
            incense cauldron: the smoke is said to bestow health and you’ll see people wafting it onto their bodies.
            <br><br>
            At the eastern edge of the temple complex is Asakusa-jinja, a shrine built in honour of the brothers who
            discovered the Kannon statue that inspired the construction of Senso-ji. (Historically, Japan's two
            religions, Buddhism and Shinto, were intertwined and it was not uncommon for temples to include shrines
            and
            vice versa.) The current building, painted a deep shade of red, dates to 1649 and is a rare example of
            early
            Edo architecture. It's also the epicentre of one of Tokyo’s most important festivals, May’s Sanja
            Matsuri.

        <h4>
            Tokyo Skytree
        </h4>
        <div class="div-h4">
            Tokyo Skytree opened in May 2012 as the world’s tallest ‘free-standing tower’ at 634m. Its silvery
            exterior
            of steel mesh morphs from a triangle at the base to a circle at 300m. There are two observation decks,
            at
            350m and 450m. You can see more of the city during daylight hours – at peak visibility you can see up to
            100km away, all the way to Mt Fuji – but it is at night that Tokyo appears truly beautiful.
            <br><br>
            It's not the world's tallest man-made structure (that honour goes to Dubai's Burj Khalifa at 829.8 m),
            but
            it is Japan's. The panorama from the lower observatory, the Tembo Deck, is spectacular. Don’t miss the
            small
            section of glass floor panels, where you can see – dizzyingly – all the way to the ground.
            <br><br>
            The upper observatory, the Tembo Galleria, beneath the digital broadcasting antennas, features a
            circular
            glass corridor for more vertiginous thrills. The elevator between the two has a glass front, so you can
            see
            yourself racing up the tower as the city grows smaller below.

        <h5>
            Edo-Tokyo Museum
        </h5>
        <div class="div-h5">
            Tokyo's history museum documents the city's transformation from tidal flatlands to feudal capital to
            modern
            metropolis via detailed scale re-creations of townscapes, villas and tenement homes, plus artefacts such
            as
            ukiyo-e and old maps. Reopened in March 2018 after a renovation, the museum also has interactive
            displays,
            multilingual touch-screen panels and audio guides.
            <br><br>
            Still, the best way to tour the museum is with one of the gracious English-speaking volunteer guides,
            who
            can really bring the history to life. Reserve two weeks in advance (details on the website), though
            sometimes a free person is available on the day, if you check at the reception counter. There is a lot
            here
            and it would take a half-day to experience it all; if you're pressed for time, prioritise the section on
            Edo. A guide can also help steer you to the highlights. Skip the temporary exhibitions as they usually
            lack
            English (and the main exhibition is more than enough).
            <br><br>
            The museum is 62m tall – the same height as the 17th-century keep at Edo-jo, the castle of the shogun –
            and
            the design, by Kiyonori Kikutake, is… something. The architect intended the structure to resemble a
            traditional raised-floor building in geometric abstraction. In reality, it looks a bit like an enormous
            concrete alien, in the style of the sprites from the video game Space Invaders.
