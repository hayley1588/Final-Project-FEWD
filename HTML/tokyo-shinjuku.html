        <h2>Shinjuku</h2>
        <div class="under-title-section">
            Shinjuku is a whole city within the city; developed in the latter half of the 20th century, it's become
            widely
            synonymous with Tokyo itself. The breadth and scale are simply awesome – over three million people a day
            pass
            through the train station.

            <h3>
                Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building
            </h3>
            <div class="div-h3">
                Tokyo's city hall – a landmark building designed by Tange Kenzo – has observatories (202m) atop both the
                south and north towers of Building 1 (the views are virtually the same). On a clear day (morning is
                best),
                you may catch a glimpse of Mt Fuji beyond the urban sprawl to the west; after dark, it's illuminated
                buildings all the way to the horizon. Direct-access elevators are on the ground floor; last entry is at
                10.30pm.
                <br><br>
                Symbolic of the city's bureaucratic might, the granite structure, completed in 1991, looks somewhat like
                a
                pixelated cathedral, or perhaps the lair of an animated villain.

            <h4>
                Golden Gai
            </h4>
            <div class="div-h4">
                Golden Gai – a Shinjuku institution for over half a century – is a collection of tiny bars, often
                literally
                no bigger than a closet and seating maybe a dozen. Each is as unique and eccentric as the ‘master’ or
                ‘mama’
                who runs it. In a sense, Golden Gai, which has a strong visual appeal, with its low-slung wooden
                buildings,
                is their work of art. It's more than just a place to drink.
                <br><br>
                The district has long been a gathering spot for artists, writers and musicians. Originally many bars
                here
                functioned more like clubhouses for various creative industries. Some bars prefer to keep their doors
                closed
                to customers who aren't regulars (foreign tourists included) to preserve that old atmosphere; others
                will
                welcome you (if there is space, of course). Recently there's been a changing of the guard, as new,
                younger
                owners take over, and the exclusive atmosphere of old is giving way to a lively scene of international
                bar
                hoppers, instinctively drawn to Golden Gai's free spirit.
                <br><br>
                The best way to experience Golden Gai is to stroll the lanes and pick a place that suits your mood. Bars
                that expressly welcome tourists have English signs posted on their doors. Many bars have a cover charge
                (usually ¥500 to ¥1500), which is often posted on the door.
                <br><br>
                Note that while Golden Gai is highly photogenic, it is also private property; do not take photos unless
                you
                have explicit permission.
