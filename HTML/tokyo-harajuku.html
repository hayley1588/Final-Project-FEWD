    <h2>Harajuku</h2>
    <div class="under-title-section">
        Harajuku is one of Tokyo's biggest draws thanks to its grand shrine, Meiji-jingu. It's also Tokyo's
        real-life
        catwalk, a world-renowned shopping destination where the ultra-chic (and chic in training) come to browse
        and be
        seen.

        <h3>
            Meiji-jingu
        </h3>
        <div class="div-h3">
            Tokyo’s grandest Shinto shrine is dedicated to the Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken, whose reign
            (1868–1912)
            coincided with Japan's transformation from isolationist, feudal state to modern nation. Constructed in
            1920,
            the shrine was destroyed in WWII air raids and rebuilt in 1958; however, unlike so many of Japan’s
            postwar
            reconstructions, Meiji-jingu has atmosphere in spades. Note that the shrine is currently undergoing
            renovations bit by bit in preparation for its 100th anniversary, but will remain open.
            <br><br>
            The main shrine, built of unpainted cypress wood with a copper-plated roof, is in a wooded grove
            accessed
            via a long winding gravel path. At the start of the path you'll pass through the first of several
            towering
            wooden torii (entrance gates). Just before the final torii is the temizuya (font), where visitors purify
            themselves by pouring water over their hands (purity is a tenet of Shintoism).
            <br><br>
            To make an offering at the main shrine, toss a ¥5 coin in the box, bow twice, clap your hands twice and
            then
            bow again. Nearby there are kiosks selling ema (wooden plaques on which prayers are written) and omamori
            (charms).
            <br><br>
            The shrine itself occupies only a small fraction of the sprawling forested grounds, which contain some
            120,000 trees collected from all over Japan. Of this, only the strolling garden Meiji-jingu Gyoen is
            accessible to the public. The Meiji emperor himself designed the iris garden here to please the empress
            and
            the garden is most impressive when the irises bloom in June.

        <h4>
            Yoyogi-koen
        </h4>
        <div class="div-h4">
            If it’s a sunny and warm weekend afternoon, you can count on there being a crowd lazing around the large
            grassy expanse that is Yoyogi-koen. You'll usually find revellers and noisemakers of all stripes, from
            hula-hoopers to African drum circles to retro greasers dancing around a boom box. It’s an excellent
            place
            for a picnic and probably the only place in the city where you can reasonably toss a Frisbee without
            fear of
            hitting someone.
            <br><br>
            During the warmer months, festivals take place on the plaza across from the park (see website, in
            Japanese,
            for a schedule). Cherry blossoms draw huge crowds and parties that go late into the night.

        <h5>
            Omote-sando
        </h5>
        <div class="div-h5">
            This broad, tree-lined boulevard is lined with boutiques from the top European fashion houses. More
            interesting are the buildings themselves, designed by some of the biggest names in Japanese
            architecture.
            There's no better (or more convenient) place to gain an overview of Japan's current sense of design.
            Highlights include the Dior boutique by SANAA (Nishizawa Ryue and Sejima Kazuyo) and the Tod's boutique
            by
            Ito Toyo.
            <br><br>
            Perhaps surprisingly, Omote-sando was originally designed as the official approach to Meiji-jingu;
            that's
            why it's unusually straight and wide (as far as Tokyo streets go).

        <h6>
            Takeshita-dori
        </h6>
        <div class="div-h6">
            This is Tokyo’s famous fashion bazaar. It's an odd mixed bag: newer shops selling trendy, youthful
            styles
            alongside stores still invested in the trappings of decades of subcultures past (plaid and safety pins
            for
            the punks; colourful tutus for the decora; Victorian dresses for the Gothic Lolitas). Be warned: this
            pedestrian alley is a pilgrimage site for teens from all over Japan, which means it can be packed.
