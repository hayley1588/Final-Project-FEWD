    <h2>Ginza</h2>
    <div class="under-title-section">
        Ginza is Tokyo's most polished neighbourhood, a luxury fashion centre resplendent with department stores,
        art
        galleries and exclusive restaurants; the city's principal kabuki theatre, Kabukiza, is here, too.

        <h3>
            Hama-rikyu Onshi-teien
        </h3>
        <div class="div-h3">
            This beautiful garden, one of Tokyo’s finest, is all that remains of a shogunate summer villa next to
            Tokyo
            Bay. There's a large pond with an island, connected by a causeway, upon which sits the teahouse Nakajima
            no
            Ochaya, where you can sip matcha (¥740, traditional sweet included). Don't miss the spectacularly
            manicured
            300-year-old black pine tree near the Ote-mon entrance.
            <br><br>
            There are free guided tours of the garden in English at 11am on Saturdays and Mondays (except during
            August).
            <br><br>
            A great way to access or depart from the garden is via Tokyo Cruise, which runs water buses from
            Asakusa,
            via the Sumida-gawa (Sumida River), to a pier on the garden's edge.

        <h4>
            Tsukiji Market
        </h4>
        <div class="div-h4">
            Tokyo's main wholesale market may have moved to Toyosu, but there are many reasons to visit its old
            home.
            The tightly packed rows of vendors (which once formed the Outer Market) hawk market and culinary-related
            goods, such as dried fish, seaweed, kitchen knives, rubber boots and crockery. It's also a fantastic
            place
            to eat, with great street food and a huge concentration of small restaurants and cafes, most
            specialising in
            seafood.
            <br><br>
            The area can get very crowded – avoid the narrow lanes if you're pushing a stroller or pulling luggage.
            Come
            early as most shops close by 2pm. Some shops are closed on Sundays and Wednesdays.

        <h5>
            Nakagin Capsule Tower
        </h5>
        <div class="div-h5">
            This early-1970s building by Kurokawa Kisho is a seminal work of Metabolism, an experimental
            architecture
            movement to create fluid, more organic structures. The tower is made up of self-contained pods around a
            central core that are meant to be replaced every 20 years. Long story short: they were never replaced
            and
            the building is just shy of being condemned, though remaining residents (and many more fans) have been
            campaigning to save it. Entry is by tour only.
            <br><br>
            Tours run a few times a month, usually on Saturday or Sunday (in Japanese), with an English tour on
            Thursday
            at noon. The schedule is posted monthly on the website. To reserve, send an email in simple English with
            your name, party size and requested tour date. Given the condition of the building, it's not a good idea
            to
            bring small children.
