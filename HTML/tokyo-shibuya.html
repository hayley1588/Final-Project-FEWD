    <div class="under-title-section">
        Shibuya, the heart of Tokyo's youth culture, hits you over the head with its sheer presence: the continuous
        flow
        of people, the glowing video screens and the tangible buzz. All of this is summed up by its top attraction,
        Shibuya Crossing.

        <h3>
            Shibuya Crossing
        </h3>
        <div class="div-h3">
            Rumoured to be the busiest intersection in the world (and definitely in Japan), Shibuya Crossing is like
            a
            giant beating heart, sending people in all directions with every pulsing light change. Nowhere else says
            ‘Welcome to Tokyo’ better than this. Hundreds of people – and at peak times upwards of 3000 people –
            cross
            at a time, coming from all directions at once, yet still to dodging each other with a practised,
            nonchalant
            agility.
            <br><br>
            Mag's Park, the rooftop of the Shibuya 109-2 department store, has the best views over the
            neighbourhood's
            famous scramble crossing. It's screened with plexiglass, so you can still get good photos, without
            having to
            worry about losing anything over the edge).
            <br><br>
            The intersection is most impressive after dark on a Friday or Saturday night, when the crowds pouring
            out of
            the station are at their thickest and neon-lit by the signs above. The rhythms here are, however, tied
            to
            the train station and after the last train pulls out for the night, the intersection becomes eerily
            quiet.

        <h4>
            Hachiko Statue
        </h4>
        <div class="div-h4">
            Every evening, Akita dog Hachiko would go to Shibuya Station to greet his companion. It's a practice he
            kept
            up everyday for 10 years after the professor's death, and until his own. This small bronze statue in
            front
            of Shibuya Station (outside the eponymous Hachiko exit) was put up in honour of the dog's unwavering
            loyaly.
            (Hachiko was buried alongside the professor.)
            <br><br>
            The statue is a well known landmark and the surrounding plaza is Shibuya's de facto rendezvous point
            (and
            always full of people).

        <h5>
            Shibuya Sky
        </h5>
        <div class="div-h5">
            From below, Shibuya Sky, the rooftop observatory atop Shibuya's newest tower, Shibuya Scramble Square,
            looks
            like one of those harrowing infinity pools – people leaning over the edge of nothingness. Rest-assured,
            it
            has plenty of safeguards, but the open-air, 360-degree views from 229m (the tallest in Shibuya) are
            still
            awesome. Also there are sofas and hammocks for lounging up here.
            <br><br>
            The entrance is on the 14th floor, from where an elevator takes you up to the 45th. To avoid queues (and
            save a few hundred yen) purchase tickets online in advance; you must choose the specific date and time.
            Note
            that there is some strobe-effect lighting once your enter. There's an indoor observatory on the 46th
            floor
            (open even when the roof is closed for bad weather). Anything that doesn't fit in your pockets needs to
            be
            checked into a (free) locker before visiting the roof.
