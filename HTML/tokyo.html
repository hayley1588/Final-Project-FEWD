            More than any one sight, it's the city itself that enchants visitors. It's a sprawling, organic thing,
            stretching as far as the eye can see. Always changing, and with a diverse collection of neighbourhoods,
            no
            two experiences of the city are ever the same. Some neighbourhoods feel like a vision from the future,
            with
            ever taller, sleeker structures popping up each year; others evoke the past with low-slung wooden
            buildings
            and glowing lanterns radiating surprising warmth; elsewhere, drab concrete blocks hide art galleries and
            cocktail bars and every lane hints at possible discoveries.

        <h4>
            Art & Culture
        </h4>
        <div class="div-h4">
            In Tokyo you can experience the whole breadth of Japanese arts and culture. Centuries-old forms of
            performing arts still play on stages and sumo tournaments draw crowds; every spring, Tokyoites head
            outside
            to appreciate the cherry blossoms – a tradition older than the city itself. There are museums covering
            every
            era of Japanese art history and also ones that focus on the contemporary – challenging the old
            distinctions
            between art with a capital A, pop culture and technology. But there's a playful side to all of this,
            too:
            Tokyo is, after all, a city whose public artworks include a scale model of an anime robot.

            Tokyo's Food Scene
        </h5>
        <div class="div-h5">
            When it comes to Tokyo superlatives, the city's food scene tops the list. But we're not just talking
            about
            the famous restaurants and the celebrity chefs: what Tokyo excels at is consistency across the board.
            Wherever you are, you're usually within 100m of a good, if not great, restaurant. It's a scene that
            careens
            nonchalantly between the highs and lows: it's not unusual for a top-class sushi restaurant to share the
            same
            block as an oil-spattered noodle joint, and for both to be equally adored. Tokyoites love dining out;
            join
            them, and delight in the sheer variety of tastes and experiences the city has to offer.

        <h6>
            Convenience Factor
        </h6>
        <div class="div-h6">
            Tokyo can seem daunting at first: the subway map – a tangle of intersecting lines – is often compared to
            a
            bowl of noodles. But once you get out there, you'll be surprised how easy it is to navigate. That subway
            can
            take you everywhere you want to go; trains are frequent (though sometimes uncomfortably crowded) and
            almost
            always on time, and stations are well-signposted in English. That's not to say you won't occasionally
            find
            yourself frustratingly disorientated, but locals are generally eager to help you get back on track.
